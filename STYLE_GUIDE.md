# ComplyTime Organization Style Guide

This document provides an overview of engineering standards, contribution workflows,
and architectural principles for the ComplyTime organization. The authoritative
source for coding standards is the
[constitution](https://github.com/complytime/org-infra/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md),
managed in [org-infra](https://github.com/complytime/org-infra) and synced to all
repositories as `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## 1. High-Level Engineering Principles

These principles guide *how* we think about problems and *why* we make specific
technical decisions. We value long-term sustainability over short-term speed.

### I. Single Source of Truth (Centralized Constants)

Values used in multiple places or that may change over time MUST be centralized.
Magic strings (e.g., `"active"`, `"https://api..."`) and magic numbers (e.g.,
`86400`) MUST NOT appear inline within logic. These values MUST be moved into
dedicated files (e.g., `internal/consts/consts.go`, `settings.py`).

**Rationale**: Prevents divergence -- updating a timeout from 30s to 60s in one
file ensures every part of the application updates automatically. Avoids "shotgun
surgery" -- a single logical change MUST NOT require search-and-replace across
multiple files, reducing the risk of missed instances and introduced bugs.

### II. Simplicity & Isolation

Code MUST reduce complexity to improve security and maintainability. Functions
MUST follow the Single Responsibility Principle -- small, focused, and
independently testable. Prefer isolated, composable parts over monolithic and
inflexible approaches.

**Rationale**: Small, isolated components reduce cognitive load, improve
testability, and minimize the blast radius of changes.

### III. Incremental Improvement

Improvements to existing code are welcome, but each contribution MUST remain
focused on a single concern. Changes unrelated to the current task (refactoring,
formatting fixes, better naming) MUST be proposed in a separate commit or Pull
Request. Before including incidental improvements, assess their impact on other
core principles and justify the scope expansion.

**Rationale**: Keeping aesthetic changes separate from logic fixes ensures that
PRs remain atomic and easier to review.

### IV. Readability First

Code is read far more often than it is written. All code MUST prioritize clarity
for the reader over brevity or convenience for the writer.

**Implementation**:
- **Explicit Naming**: Variable and function names MUST clearly describe their
  intent (e.g., use `days_until_expiration` instead of `d`).
- **Avoid "Clever" Code**: MUST NOT use complex one-liners or obscure language
  features that require deep mental parsing. If the implementation is hard to
  explain, it is a bad implementation.
- **Self-Documenting**: The code structure itself MUST explain the logic. Comments
  MUST explain the *why* (business logic/intent), not the *what* (syntax).

**Rationale**: Readable code reduces onboarding time, prevents bugs from
misunderstanding, and enables faster debugging.

### V. Do Not Reinvent the Wheel

Leverage existing solutions and validate their quality.

**Implementation**:
- **Prefer Established Libraries**: MUST NOT introduce custom implementations
  when a well-established, actively maintained library or cloud-native solution
  exists for the same purpose.
- **Vet Dependencies**: New dependencies MUST be actively maintained (recent
  release activity) and have a clear governance model. SHOULD NOT adopt abandoned
  or single-maintainer projects for critical functionality.
- **No Hard Forks**: MUST NOT create hard forks or permanent local workarounds
  for upstream libraries. If upstream changes are needed, they SHOULD be
  contributed back in a separate effort.

**Rationale**: Using well-maintained libraries reduces maintenance burden.
Contributing back improves the ecosystem and reduces the technical debt of
maintaining internal patches.

### VI. Composability (The Unix Philosophy)

Programs and functions MUST do one thing and do it well. Programs and functions
MUST be designed to work together. All tools MUST be modular. Output from one
tool MUST be easily consumable as input for another (e.g., standard JSON/YAML
streams).

**Rationale**: Modular tools enable composition, reuse, and integration with
external systems. Standard formats ensure interoperability.

### VII. Convention Over Configuration

Decrease the number of decisions a developer or user needs to make. Provide
defaults aligned with the most common use case. Users SHOULD only need to specify
configuration when deviating from the established standard.

**Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load, accelerates onboarding, and prevents
configuration errors through well-chosen defaults.

## 2. Repository Structure & Standards

Every repository under the ComplyTime organization MUST contain the following
standard files in the root directory to ensure a consistent developer experience:

| File | Description | Standard |
|:---|:----|:----|
| `README.md` | Project overview, installation, and usage. | Markdown |
| `LICENSE` | Legal terms of use. | **Apache License 2.0** |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines for contributors. | Link to org-wide guide or repo-specific details. |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Community standards. | Standard Contributor Covenant |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy. | Vulnerability reporting instructions |
| `.github/` | GitHub configuration. | Issue templates, PR templates, workflows. |

These files MUST link to org-wide definitions whenever available and MAY be
incremented with repository-specific content.

---

## 3. Contribution Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: `main` is the stable production branch.
- **Feature Branches**: All changes MUST be developed on branches created from
  `main`.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Atomic Changes**: PRs MUST address a single concern and be small enough for
  focused review. Large, multi-concern PRs SHOULD be split into separate
  submissions.
- **No Merge Commits**: Pull request branches MUST NOT contain merge commits.
  Contributors MUST rebase onto the target branch when necessary to keep history
  linear.
- **Review Requirement**: All PRs REQUIRE review from at least two Maintainers.
- **CI/CD Gates**:
  - **Standard**: All PRs MUST generally pass automated checks (linting, testing,
    build) before merging.
  - **Exceptions**: Checks MAY occasionally fail due to external issues or
    transient flakes. In these rare instances, maintainers MAY agree on exceptions
    to merge specific PRs despite a failing status.
- **Pull Request Title Format**: `<type>: <description>` (e.g.,
  `feat: implement validation logic`)

### Commit Messages

All commit messages MUST follow the **Conventional Commits**
[specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Commit Trailers

- **Signed-off-by**: All commits MUST include a `Signed-off-by` trailer with the
  author's name and email (use `git commit -s`). This certifies the contributor's
  right to submit the code under the project's license
  ([Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)).
- **Assisted-by**: Commits that were authored or substantially assisted by an AI
  tool MUST include an `Assisted-by` trailer identifying the tool and model (e.g.,
  `Assisted-by: OpenCode (claude-opus-4-6)`). This ensures transparency and
  traceability of AI-assisted contributions.

---

## 4. Infrastructure Standards Centralization

Workflows, configurations, and templates SHOULD be centralized in the
[org-infra](https://github.com/complytime/org-infra) repository, which serves as
the canonical source for organization-wide CI/CD standards. Repository-specific
overrides MAY exist but MUST NOT conflict with centralized definitions. Changes to
shared infrastructure MUST be proposed in org-infra first.

---

## 5. Coding Standards

### Guidelines for All Programming Languages

- **Empty Line at End of File**: All files MUST end with a single empty line.
  This ensures clean version control diffs and adheres to POSIX standards.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Repositories SHOULD configure pre-commit and pre-push
  hooks via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
- **Makefile**: Repositories MUST use a Makefile to centralize code-specific
  commands.
- **Testing**: All code MUST have tests. Test functions MUST use descriptive names
  and include edge cases. Inputs from external sources MUST be tested. Each test
  scenario MUST include at least one positive and one negative test case to verify
  that errors and exceptions are properly handled.
- **Line Length**: Lines in source code MUST be limited to 99 characters unless
  exceeding the limit demonstrably improves readability. YAML files are exempt and
  follow the `.yamllint.yml` configuration instead.
- **Lint**: Code MUST have zero lint issues according to the lint configuration
  defined in the repository. No trailing spaces.
- **Lint Configuration Awareness**: Before making code changes, contributors and
  agents MUST read the repository's lint and formatter configuration files to
  understand the enforced rules. All generated or modified code MUST conform to
  these configurations. Standard configuration files include:
  - `.golangci.yml` -- Go linting rules
  - `ruff.toml` or `pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]` -- Python linting rules
  - `.mega-linter.yml` -- Multi-language linting in CI
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` -- Pre-commit and pre-push hook definitions
  - `.yamllint.yml` -- YAML linting rules

### Go

#### General Guidelines

- **File Naming**: File names MUST use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g.,
  `my_file.go`).
- **Package Names**: Package names MUST be short, concise, and lowercase. MUST
  NOT use underscores or mixed caps.
- **Error Handling**: Errors MUST always be checked and handled appropriately.
  Errors SHOULD be returned to the caller when the current function cannot resolve
  them.

#### Licensing and File Headers

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

#### Code Formatting

Formatting SHOULD be aligned with native go format tools,
[`goimports`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) and
[`go fmt`](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt).

#### Additional Guidelines

Repositories SHOULD define Go-specific lint rules (e.g., via `.golangci.yml`) and
run them in CI/CD. These checks SHOULD also be run locally before submitting a PR.

### Python

#### General Guidelines

- **Type Hinting**: All Python code MUST use type hints to improve readability and
  tooling support.

#### Licensing and File Headers

```python
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

#### Code Formatting

- **Style**: Code MUST be formatted with `black` and `isort`, or equivalently with
  `ruff format` and `ruff check --select I`.
- **Lint**: Code MUST pass `ruff` linting.
- **Static type check**: Code SHOULD pass `mypy` static type checking. Repositories
  with minimal scripting (e.g., a single utility script) MAY omit `mypy` if type
  hints are present.
- **Non-Python files**: SHOULD use
  [Megalinter](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter) or equivalent to lint
  non-Python files in a CI task.

## 6. AI-Native Development

ComplyTime follows an AI-native development workflow. For the full standard, see
[AI_NATIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md](./AI_NATIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md).

Key points:
- All AI-assisted commits MUST include the `Assisted-by` trailer
- Agent choice is personal; committed files ensure consistent outcomes
- Convention packs encode coding rules that agents enforce
- The review council provides automated multi-perspective review on every PR
